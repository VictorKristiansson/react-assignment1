        <p>I’ve just started my journey as a programmer, eager to learn and explore new technologies. 
            This portfolio highlights the projects I’ve worked on so far, 
            each one marking a step in my early development. While I’m still in the beginning stages, 
            I’m excited to keep learning and improving over time.
